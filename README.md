LOGIN and REGISTRATION:

The login.php script handles the login functionality for a room booking system. It starts by checking if the form has been submitted via the POST method. It then retrieves the user's input email and password, fetches the user data from the database based on the email, and verifies the password using `password_verify`.If the email and password are correct, the user's ID and type are stored in the session. If the "Remember Me" checkbox is checked, cookies for the email and password are set to remember the user's login credentials. Otherwise, the cookies are unset to ensure security. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the home page. If there is an error (such as an invalid email or password), an error message is displayed on the login form. The form also pre-fills the email and password fields with stored values if available and provides a link to the registration page for new users.

The registration.php script facilitates the registration process for a room booking system. Upon form submission, the script validates the user's input by checking if all required fields are filled, ensuring a valid UOB email format, and confirming the password and confirmation password match. If validation is successful, the script hashes the password using `password_hash` for security. It then queries the database to check if the email is already registered. If not, it inserts the user's data into the user's table, assigns a user type based on the email, and displays a success message. In case of any errors during the process, such as existing email or database issues, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user. After successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page to access the room booking website.
